 ## Summary for today,s class
 =========================
In today’s blog post we,ve discovered a little known secret about the OpenCV library — OpenCV ships out-of-the-box with a more accurate face detector (as compared to OpenCV’s Haar cascades).

The more accurate OpenCV face detector is deep learning based, and in particular, utilizes the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework with ResNet as the base network.

Thanks to the hard work of Aleksandr Rybnikov and the other contributors to OpenCV’s dnn  module, we can enjoy these more accurate OpenCV face detectors in our own applications.

The deep learning face detectors can be hard to find in the OpenCV library, so
for your convenience, I have gathered the Caffe prototxt and weight files for you — just use the “Downloads” form below to download the (more accurate) deep learning-based OpenCV face detector.

See you next week with another great computer vision + deep learning tutorial!
