#For the detect_faces.py
========================
We initialize a VideoStream object specifying camera with index zero as the source 
(in general this would be your laptop’s built in camera or your desktop’s first camera detected).
A few quick notes here:

Raspberry Pi + picamera users can replace Line 25:
 with vs = VideoStream(usePiCamera=True).start() if you wish to use the Raspberry Pi camera module.
If you to parse a video file (rather than a video stream),
 swap out the VideoStream  class for FileVideoStream. 
 You can learn more about the FileVideoStream class in this blog post: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/02/06/faster-video-file-fps-with-cv2-videocapture-and-opencv/
